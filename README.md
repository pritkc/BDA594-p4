## Introduction
Welcome to my GitHub! I'm currently exploring Big Data and learning more about its vast potential. 

## My definition of Big Data
Big Data is all about huge, complex datasets that entry-level tools can’t easily handle.
It’s not just the size that matters, but also the different types of data (variety), complexity, and how fast(velocity) it's coming in. 
To make sense of it, we need smarter tools and techniques to find useful insights hidden in all that information
